## Setup and Usage

requires python3+, urllib3, requests, bs4, PIL, Numpy

This script can be used through CLI or GUI(coming soon)

CLI Usage: ```python cardMaker.py "song name" "song artist" "path\and\filename\without\extension\"```

Example: ```python cardMaker.py "Tick Tock" "Joji" ".\images\ticktockjoji```
